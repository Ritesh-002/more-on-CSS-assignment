A pseudo-class in CSS is called "pseudo" because it's not a real or physical class that you add to HTML elements. Instead, it's a special keyword that allows you to define styles for elements based on their state or position in relation to the document tree. Pseudo-classes provide a way to style elements dynamically without needing to modify the HTML markup itself.

For example, the :hover pseudo-class is used to apply styles to an element when a user hovers over it with their mouse. Similarly, the :first-child pseudo-class targets an element that is the first child of its parent element, regardless of its tag name or class.
